### Overview and notes

This note focuses on the structure of **Stiefel manifolds** $V_k(\mathbb{R}^n)$ and **Grassmann manifolds** $G_k(\mathbb{R}^n)$, as well as their connection through quotient spaces of the orthogonal group $O(n)$.

It proves the existence of a homeomorphism

$$
\psi_{k,n}: O(n)/(O(n-k)O'(k)) \longrightarrow G_{k,n},
$$

and demonstrates the commutative relationship among $O(n)$, $V_{k,n}$, and $G_{k,n}$.

This result gives a geometric realization of the Grassmann manifold as a **homogeneous space**, forming a theoretical basis for understanding **characteristic classes** and **fiber bundle topology**.
