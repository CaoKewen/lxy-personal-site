### Note information

- **Subject:** Homological Algebra  
- **Resource:** the book where the questions are from
- **Containing:** Proofs concerning flat and projective modules, exactness of tensor and Hom functors, and projective objects in chain complexes.

### Overview and Notes

This note provides detailed proofs of several fundamental results in **homological algebra**, focusing on the behavior of tensor and Hom functors, the characterization of flat and projective modules, and the structure of projective objects in chain complexes.

Key topics include:
- Equivalence between the exactness of $\mathrm{Hom}_R(-,N)$ and the exactness of module sequences.  
- Characterizations of flatness using $\mathrm{Tor}$ vanishing, injectivity of $1_M \otimes i$, and the Baer criterion.  
- The relation between flat and injective modules via character modules $B^* = \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbb{Z}}(B, \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z})$.  
- The equivalence of projectivity and split exactness in the category of chain complexes $\mathrm{Ch}(\mathcal{A})$.  
- Construction of enough projectives in $\mathrm{Comp}(\mathcal{A})$ and verification of properties of quasi-isomorphisms.

These results provide the categorical and homological foundation for deeper study of **derived functors**, **triangulated categories**, and **derived categories**—core tools in modern algebraic geometry and category theory.
