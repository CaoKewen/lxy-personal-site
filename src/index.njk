  <h2>Welcome to Xinyu Liu's Learning Journal!</h2>
  <p>I am a <strong>M.S. candidate</strong> in the Department of Mathematics at Capital Normal University (CNU) in Beijing. My primary academic interests are <strong>Stable Homotopy Theory</strong>, <strong>Category Theory</strong>, and <strong>Chromatic Homotopy Theory</strong>. I am deeply fascinated by the algebraic and structural side of modern topology and am actively preparing to pursue Ph.D. research in this area.</p> 
  <p>This website serves as my public learning journal, documenting my independent study of these topics. It is a space to organize notes from texts and papers, track key concepts, and log my preparation for future research. I am always excited to learn and welcome connections with others who share these interests.</p>
