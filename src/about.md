# About Me

- Name: Xinyu Liu
- Site: LXY's Learning Journal
- Email: lxytopology@163.com

I am a <strong>graduate student</strong> in the Department of Mathematics at Capital Normal University (CNU) in Beijing. My primary academic interests are <strong>Stable Homotopy Theory</strong>, <strong>Category Theory</strong>, and <strong>Chromatic Homotopy Theory</strong>. I am deeply fascinated by the algebraic and structural side of modern topology and am actively preparing to pursue Ph.D. research in this area.

This website serves as my public learning journal, documenting my independent study of these topics. It is a space to organize notes from texts and papers, track key concepts, and log my preparation for future research. I am always excited to learn and welcome connections with others who share these interests.
