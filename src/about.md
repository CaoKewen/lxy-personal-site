## 👋 Introduction

Hi! I'm **Xinyu Liu**, a Master's student in Mathematics at **Capital Normal University (CNU)** in Beijing, China.

I am passionate about the deep structures underlying modern topology. I am currently preparing for Ph.D. research and am **actively seeking a fully-funded Ph.D. position for the Fall 2027 intake.**

## 🎓 Academic Background

**Education**
- **M.S. in Mathematics** — Capital Normal University (CNU, Beijing) (2024 - **Expected June 2027**)
- **B.S. in Mathematics** — Zhengzhou University (ZZU) (2020 - 2024)

**Research Interests**
- **Primary Fields:** Stable Homotopy Theory, Chromatic Homotopy Theory, Higher Category Theory.

- **Related Interests:** Algebraic K-Theory, model categories, and applications of homotopy theory to geometric topology (e.g., manifold invariants, scissors congruence).

## 📚 Current Focus

I'm currently diving deep into:

- **Stable Homotopy Theory**: Understanding the stable category through spectra
- **Chromatic Methods**: Exploring the chromatic filtration and Morava K-theories
- **Category-Theoretic Foundations**: Model categories, ∞-categories, and their applications

My goal is to build a solid foundation in these areas to contribute meaningfully to research in homotopy theory.

## 💻 About This Site

This website serves as my **public learning journal**. Here I:

- Document notes from textbooks and research papers
- Organize key concepts and theorems
- Track my progress and understanding
- Share insights with the mathematical community

I believe in **learning in public** — making mistakes, asking questions, and growing through the process. And I'm always excited to connect with fellow mathematicians and topology enthusiasts. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss topology, share resources, or collaborate on projects.

## 🌟 Beyond Mathematics

When I'm not focused on topology, I enjoy:
- 🔭 Watching popular science videos, especially about physics and astronomy.
- 🎾 Playing tennis and badminton.
- ☕ Relaxing and spending time with friends.
